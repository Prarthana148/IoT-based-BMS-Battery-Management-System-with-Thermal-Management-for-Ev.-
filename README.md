➢The problem statement represents an IoT-based Battery Management System (BMS) 
integrated with a Thermal Management System for electric vehicles (EVs).
➢ The system uses temperature sensors to collect data from key EV components, such 
as the battery, motor, and power converters, which is processed by the ESP8266 
microcontroller.
➢ If the temperature exceeds a critical threshold, the cooling system is activated to 
maintain safe operating conditions.
➢ The IoT connectivity enables real-time data transmission to a cloud server, allowing 
users to monitor battery status through a connected device remotely.
➢ The system ensures efficient thermal regulation, prevents overheating and enhances 
both battery safety and lifespan.
➢ By providing real-time monitoring and control, it optimizes EV performance, 
improves safety, and increases battery longevity and efficiency.
